This project aligns seamlessly with the **AI for Social Good / Information Integrity** track, as it leverages advanced natural language processing, multimodal data fusion, and credibility modeling to combat one of the most critical societal challengesâ€”digital misinformation. By integrating transformer-based claim detection, semantic verification, and adaptive feedback mechanisms, it operationalizes artificial intelligence for large-scale, explainable truth inference, promoting responsible information ecosystems and fostering public trust through transparent, data-driven insights.


An advanced multimodal misinformation intelligence framework engineered to autonomously ingest and preprocess heterogeneous digital content from social media, blogs, and short-form media; employ transformer-based architectures for claim detection, contextual evidence retrieval, and semantic stance alignment; and synthesize probabilistic truth attributions through credibility-weighted inference mechanisms, culminating in an adaptive, self-improving public intelligence dashboard that elucidates misinformation dynamics with explainable, data-driven precision.
